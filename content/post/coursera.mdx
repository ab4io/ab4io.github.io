I felt like this is something common and many of you probably already knew about it until a few days ago when my friend started complaining about not being able to take a course because he didn't have the cash. Well, guess what? I discovered a way to take any course I want on Coursera for free, and get a certificate too!

Honestly, some of those courses really pushed me to the edge and made me feel burned out. But you know what? They also helped me a lot in grasping new concepts and starting fresh. So, here's the deal on how to get a free course on Coursera: all you have to do is apply for financial aid and wait for 14 days. I know, waiting might not be your thing, and you might be thinking, "Why would I wait when I could just pay for it?" But hold on a second, why throw your hard-earned money at something that's actually available for free? Instead, plan out the courses you want to take and apply for financial aid in the order you prefer.

Now, here's a little secret. Coursera made it a bit sneaky and hid the "Ask for financial aid" option, but if you come across it, please don't rush to buy the course. If you're well-off financially, sure, go ahead and buy it outright. But if you're a student like me, you can take it for free and still get that valuable certificate.

So, go ahead, explore the vast array of courses on Coursera, apply for financial aid, and make the most of this opportunity to learn without spending a dime. Trust me, it's totally worth it!

I felt like this is something common and many of you probably already knew about it until a few days ago when my friend started complaining about not being able to take a course because he didn't have the cash.

Well, guess what? I discovered a way to take any course I want on Coursera for free, and get a certificate too!

Honestly, some of those courses really pushed me to the edge and made me feel burned out.

But you know what? They also helped me a lot in grasping new concepts and starting fresh.

So, here's the deal, all you have to do is apply for financial aid and wait for 14 days.

I know, waiting might not be your thing, and you might be thinking, "Why would I wait when I could just pay for it?" But hold on a second, why throw your hard-earned money at something that's actually available for free?

Instead, plan out the courses you want to take and apply for financial aid in the order you prefer.

Now, here's a little secret. Coursera made it a bit sneaky and hid the "Financial aid available" option, it doesn't even look like a link, but if you come across it, please don't rush to buy the course or ignore that "Enroll for free" option.

If you're well-off financially, sure, go ahead and buy it outright. But if you're a student like me, you can take it for free and still get that valuable certificate.

I've also created a step-by-step tutorial in Amharic that provides detailed instructions. Here is the embedded video:

So, go ahead, explore the vast list of courses on Coursera, apply for financial aid, and make the most of this opportunity to learn without spending a penny. Trust me, it's totally worth it!

Hey there, I wanted to share with you my final year project, a telemedicine system called TenaLink. It took me a while to come up with the name, but the meaning behind it is "Tena" which means health and "Link" which means, well, you know.

In this blog post, I want to focus on the recommendation algorithm that we used in TenaLink. This feature is super important because it helps patients understand their health condition and provide them with the best possible treatment. By inputting their symptoms, the system can predict the disease and medication, description, workouts, diets that would be best suited to help them.

* The Dataset

The dataset is made up of training and testing files that contain 4,920 rows and 133 columns. We'll use this data to predict various diseases.

The columns represent the symptoms used to make these predictions. Here's a sample of what those symptoms look like:

{'itching': 0, 'skin\_rash': 1, 'nodal\_skin\_eruptions': 2, 'continuous\_sneezing': 3, 'shivering': 4, 'chills': 5, 'joint\_pain': 6, 'stomach\_pain': 7, 'acidity':8, ... 'blister': 129,  're\_sore\_around\_nose': 130, 'yellow\_crust\_ooze': 131}

The Label for prediction consists of 41 diseases for different symptoms variations in the dataset. The 41 diseases are listed as follows:

 Vertigo, AIDS, Acne, Alcoholic hepatitis, Allergy, Arthritis, Bronchial Asthma, Cervical spondylosis, Chicken pox, Chronic cholestasis, Common Cold, Dengue, Diabetes, Dimorphic hemorrhoids(piles), Drug Reaction, Fungal infection, GERD, Gastroenteritis, Heart attack, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Hepatitis D, Hepatitis E, Hypertension, Hyperthyroidism, Hypoglycemia, Hypothyroidism, Impetigo, Jaundice, Malaria, Migraine, Osteoarthritis, Paralysis (brain hemorrhage), Peptic ulcer disease, Pneumonia, Psoriasis, Tuberculosis, Typhoid, Urinary tract infection, Varicose veins, Hepatitis A.

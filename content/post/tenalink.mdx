Hey there, I wanted to share with you my final year project, a telemedicine system called TenaLink. It took me a while to come up with the name, but the meaning behind it is "Tena" which means health and "Link" which means, well, you know.

In this blog post, I want to focus on the recommendation algorithm that we used in TenaLink. This feature is super important because it helps patients understand their health condition and provide them with the best possible treatment. By inputting their symptoms, the system can predict the disease and medication, description, workouts, diets that would be best suited to help them.
